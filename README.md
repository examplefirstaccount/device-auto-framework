# Country-Specific Automation Framework  

**Disclaimer**: This project is archived as a technical demonstration only. Some applications of this technology may violate terms of service of involved platforms. Not maintained or recommended for production use.

## Components  

1. **Device Simulation**  
   - Memu emulator automation via CLI  
   - Fingerprint database management  

2. **Geo-Targeting System**  
   - Cookie-based session management  
   - Proxy integration for regional access  

3. **Browser Automation**  
   - Anti-detect browser integration (Dolphin Anty)  
   - Automated profile creation  

## Technical Stack  
- Python (Appium, Selenium, custom API clients)  
- Android emulator management  
- Cookie/proxy chaining  

## Ethical Note  
This project was discontinued after realizing the potential for misuse. It's preserved here to:  
- Document technical challenges in device fingerprinting  
- Serve as a reference for ethical automation developers  
- Demonstrate API integration patterns  

## Archive Contents  
- `/appium_auto` - Mobile automation core  
- `/dolphin_auto` - Anti-detect browser controller  
- `/emulator` - Memu emulator API client  
- `/db` - Device fingerprint database  

No active development is planned. This repository exists solely for version control of legacy code.
